## Day 1 -  Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

The first day covers the basics of RTL Design, Testbench, Simulation and Synthesis. Open-Source softwares like iverilog (simulator) and YOSYS (Synthesis) are provided through remote access in the portal to practice labs.

RTL Design -  It consists of an actual verilog code / a set of verilog codes that have the functionality to meet the required design specifications of the circuit.

TestBench - Testbench is a setup that one uses to apply a set of stimuli (test-case vector) to check the functional working of the design file.

## NOTE
```
Design may have 1 or more Primary inputs,1 or more primary outputs.
Testbench doesnot have primary inputs or primary outputs.
```
